Why I find it Interesting

Excalidraw is an online whiteboard that lets me quickly sketch out ideas in a simple, hand-drawn style. I often use it in my assignments to draw database schemas, system diagrams, and wireframes
for my websites and apps. It helps me plan visually before I start coding, and keeps everything clear and organized.
