## Why I Find It Interesting
Excalidraw is an online whiteboard that lets me sketch ideas in a simple, hand-drawn style. I use it in my assignments to draw database schemas, system diagrams, and wireframes for my websites and apps. It helps me plan visually before I start coding and keeps my work clear and organized.

I also use it for quick doodles when I need a break. It is simple, fast, and easy to share with others.
